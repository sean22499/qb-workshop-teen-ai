## Today's exercise will use the UCI heart disease dataset

- More information can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).
- This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
- The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
- A short data dictionary has been found below:
